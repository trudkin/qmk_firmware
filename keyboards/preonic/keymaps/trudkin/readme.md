# My attempt at 3 keyboards and one source

Attempting to use one set of code across my three keyboards.


1. 	Preonic        >> preonic_rev3_trudkin.bin 
2. 	Planck EZ      >> planck_ez_glow_trudkin.bin 
3. 	Ergodox EZ     >> ergodox_ez_glow_trudkin.hex


Borrowed a lot from existing code esp. *drashna*

The default build of the preonic is currently 2x2u as KC_SPACE KC_ENTER. 
To get 1x2u double tap M (used an ergodox_ez too long, enter is on the right thumb)
The LOWER and RAISE are overloaded using tap_dance, see readme in users/trudkin/layer_mod_tap.md
